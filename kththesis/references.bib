  abstract = {A fully probabilistic framework is presented for estimating local probability density functions on parameters of interest in a model of diffusion. This technique is applied to the estimation of parameters in the diffusion tensor model, and also to a simple partial volume model of diffusion. In both cases the parameters of interest include parameters defining local fiber direction. A technique is then presented for using these density functions to estimate global connectivity (i.e., the probability of the existence of a connection through the data field, between any two distant points), allowing for the quantification of belief in tractography results. This technique is then applied to the estimation of the cortical connectivity of the human thalamus. The resulting connectivity distributions correspond well with predictions from invasive tracer methods in nonhuman primate. Magn Reson Med 50:1077–1088, 2003. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {In the treatment of brain tumors, surgical intervention remains a common and effective therapeutic option. Recent advances in neuroimaging have provided neurosurgeons with new tools to overcome the challenge of differentiating healthy tissue from tumor-infiltrated tissue, with the aim of increasing the likelihood of maximizing the extent of resection volume while minimizing injury to functionally important regions. Novel applications of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and DTI-derived tractography (DDT) have demonstrated that preoperative, non-invasive mapping of eloquent cortical regions and functionally relevant white matter tracts (WMT) is critical during surgical planning to reduce postoperative deficits, which can decrease quality of life and overall survival. In this review, we summarize the latest developments of applying DTI and tractography in the context of resective surgery and highlight its utility within each stage of the neurosurgical workflow: preoperative planning and intraoperative management to improve postoperative outcomes.},

  abstract = {Tractography is a class of algorithms aiming at in vivo mapping the major neuronal pathways in the white matter from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. These techniques offer a powerful tool to noninvasively investigate at the macroscopic scale the architecture of the neuronal connections of the brain. However, unfortunately, the reconstructions recovered with existing tractography algorithms are not really quantitative even though diffusion MRI is a quantitative modality by nature. As a matter of fact, several techniques have been proposed in recent years to estimate, at the voxel level, intrinsic microstructural features of the tissue, such as axonal density and diameter, by using multicompartment models. In this paper, we present a novel framework to reestablish the link between tractography and tissue microstructure. Starting from an input set of candidate fiber-tracts, which are estimated from the data using standard fiber-tracking techniques, we model the diffusion MRI signal in each voxel of the image as a linear combination of the restricted and hindered contributions generated in every location of the brain by these candidate tracts. Then, we seek for the global weight of each of them, i.e., the effective contribution or volume, such that they globally fit the measured signal at best. We demonstrate that these weights can be easily recovered by solving a global convex optimization problem and using efficient algorithms. The effectiveness of our approach has been evaluated both on a realistic phantom with known ground-truth and in vivo brain data. Results clearly demonstrate the benefits of the proposed formulation, opening new perspectives for a more quantitative and biologically plausible assessment of the structural connectivity of the brain.},

However, despite the increasing availability of different diffusion models and tractography algorithms, it remains unclear how to select the optimal fiber reconstruction method, given certain imaging parameters. Consequently, it is of utmost importance to have a quantitative comparison of these models and algorithms and a deeper understanding of the corresponding strengths and weaknesses. In this work, we use a common dataset with known ground truth and a reproducible methodology to quantitatively evaluate the performance of various diffusion models and tractography algorithms. To examine a wide range of methods, the dataset, but not the ground truth, was released to the public for evaluation in a contest, the "Fiber Cup". 10 fiber reconstruction methods were evaluated. The results provide evidence that: 1. For high SNR datasets, diffusion models such as (fiber) orientation distribution functions correctly model the underlying fiber distribution and can be used in conjunction with streamline tractography, and 2. For medium or low SNR datasets, a prior on the spatial smoothness of either the diffusion model or the fibers is recommended for correct modelling of the fiber distribution and proper tractography results. The phantom dataset, the ground truth fibers, the evaluation methodology and the results obtained so far will remain publicly available on: http://www.lnao.fr/spip.php?rubrique79 to serve as a comparison basis for existing or new tractography methods.

Methods Fifty patients with unilateral TLE were classified either as having persistent disabling seizures (SZ) or becoming seizure-free (SZF) at least 1 year after epilepsy surgery. Their presurgical structural connectomes were reconstructed from whole-brain diffusion tensor imaging. A deep network was trained based on connectome data to classify seizure outcome using 5-fold cross-validation. Results Classification accuracy of our trained neural network showed positive predictive value (PPV; seizure freedom) of 88 ± 7\% and mean negative predictive value (NPV; seizure refractoriness) of 79 ± 8\%. Conversely, a classification model based on clinical variables alone yielded {$<$}50\% accuracy. The specific features that contributed to high accuracy classification of the neural network were located not only in the ipsilateral temporal and extratemporal regions, but also in the contralateral hemisphere. Significance Deep learning demonstrated to be a powerful statistical approach capable of isolating abnormal individualized patterns from complex datasets to provide a highly accurate prediction of seizure outcomes after surgery. Features involved in this predictive model were both ipsilateral and contralateral to the clinical foci and spanned across limbic and extralimbic networks.},

  abstract = {Tractography has become an indispensable part of brain connectivity studies. However, it is currently facing problems with reliability. In particular, a substantial amount of nerve fiber reconstructions (streamlines) in tractograms produced by state-of-the-art tractography methods are anatomically implausible. To address this problem, tractogram filtering methods have been developed to remove faulty connections in a postprocessing step. This study takes a closer look at one such method, Spherical-deconvolution Informed Filtering of Tractograms (SIFT), which uses a global optimization approach to improve the agreement between the remaining streamlines after filtering and the underlying diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data. SIFT is not suitable to judge the plausibility of individual streamlines since its results depend on the size and composition of the surrounding tractogram. To tackle this problem, we propose applying SIFT to randomly selected tractogram subsets in order to retrieve multiple assessments for each streamline. This approach makes it possible to identify streamlines with very consistent filtering results, which were used as pseudo ground truths for training classifiers. The trained classifier is able to distinguish the obtained groups of plausible and implausible streamlines with accuracy above 80\%.},

  abstract = {This paper presents MicroTrack, an algorithm that combines global tractography and direct microstructure estimation using diffusionweighted imaging data. Previous work recovers connectivity via tractography independently from estimating microstructure features, such as axon diameter distribution and density. However, the two estimates have great potential to inform one another given the common assumption that microstructural features remain consistent along fibers. Here we provide a preliminary examination of this hypothesis. We adapt a global tractography algorithm to associate axon diameter with each putative pathway and optimize both the set of pathways and their microstructural parameters to find the best fit of this holistic white-matter model to the MRI data. We demonstrate in simulation that, with a multi-shell HARDI acquisition, this approach not only improves estimates of microstructural parameters over voxel-by-voxel estimation, but provides a solution to long standing problems in tractography. In particular, a simple experiment demonstrates the resolution of the well known ambiguity between crossing and kissing fibers. The results strongly motivate further development of this kind of algorithm for brain connectivity mapping.},

However, as a method to study brain connectivity, tractography suffers from limitations, as it is indirect, inaccurate, and difficult to quantify. Despite these limitations, appropriate use of tractography can be a powerful means to address certain questions. In addition, while some of tractography's limitations are fundamental, others could be alleviated by methodological and technological advances. This article provides an overview of diffusion magnetic resonance tractography methods with a focus on how future advances might address challenges in measuring brain connectivity. Parts of this review are somewhat provocative, in the hope that they may trigger discussions possibly lacking in a field where the apparent simplicity of the methods (compared to their functional magnetic resonance imaging counterparts) can hide some fundamental issues that ultimately hinder the interpretation of findings, and cast doubt as to what tractography can really teach us about human brain anatomy.},

  abstract = {Constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) has become one of the most widely used methods to extract white matter (WM) fibre orientation information from diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) data, overcoming the crossing fibre limitations inherent in the diffusion tensor model. It is routinely used to obtain high quality fibre orientation distribution function (fODF) estimates and fibre tractograms and is increasingly used to obtain apparent fibre density (AFD) measures. Unfortunately, CSD typically only supports data acquired on a single shell in q-space. With multi-shell data becoming more and more prevalent, there is a growing need for CSD to fully support such data. Furthermore, CSD can only provide high quality fODF estimates in voxels containing WM only. In voxels containing other tissue types such as grey matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the WM response function may no longer be appropriate and spherical deconvolution produces unreliable, noisy fODF estimates. The aim of this study is to incorporate support for multi-shell data into the CSD approach as well as to exploit the unique b-value dependencies of the different tissue types to estimate a multi-tissue ODF. The resulting approach is dubbed multi-shell, multi-tissue CSD (MSMT-CSD) and is compared to the state-of-the-art single-shell, single-tissue CSD (SSST-CSD) approach. Using both simulations and real data, we show that MSMT-CSD can produce reliable WM/GM/CSF volume fraction maps, directly from the DW data, whereas SSST-CSD has a tendency to overestimate the WM volume in voxels containing GM and/or CSF. In addition, compared to SSST-CSD, MSMT-CSD can substantially increase the precision of the fODF fibre orientations and reduce the presence of spurious fODF peaks in voxels containing GM and/or CSF. Both effects translate into more reliable AFD measures and tractography results with MSMT-CSD compared to SSST-CSD.},

We find that, if the reconstruction approach is chosen carefully, single-shell dMRI data can yield the same accuracy as multi-shell data, and only moderately lower accuracy than a full Cartesian-grid sampling scheme. Our results suggest that current dMRI reconstruction approaches do not benefit substantially from ultra-high b-values or from very large numbers of diffusion-encoding directions. We also show that accuracy remains stable across dMRI voxel sizes of 1~\hspace{0pt}mm or smaller but degrades at 2~\hspace{0pt}mm, particularly in areas of complex white-matter architecture. We also show that, as the spatial resolution is reduced, axonal configurations in a dMRI voxel can no longer be modeled as a small set of distinct axon populations, violating an assumption that is sometimes made by dMRI reconstruction techniques. Our findings have implications for in vivo studies and illustrate the value of PSOCT as a source of ground-truth measurements of white-matter organization that does not suffer from the distortions typical of histological techniques.},

  abstract = {Tractography based on non-invasive diffusion imaging is central to the study of human brain connectivity. To date, the approach has not been systematically validated in ground truth studies. Based on a simulated human brain data set with ground truth tracts, we organized an open international tractography challenge, which resulted in 96 distinct submissions from 20 research groups. Here, we report the encouraging finding that most state-of-the-art algorithms produce tractograms containing 90\% of the ground truth bundles (to at least some extent). However, the same tractograms contain many more invalid than valid bundles, and half of these invalid bundles occur systematically across research groups. Taken together, our results demonstrate and confirm fundamental ambiguities inherent in tract reconstruction based on orientation information alone, which need to be considered when interpreting tractography and connectivity results. Our approach provides a novel framework for estimating reliability of tractography and encourages innovation to address its current limitations.},

Tractography takes diffusion measurements as input and produces a large collection of white-matter fascicles as output; the connectome. We introduce a method to evaluate the evidence supporting connectomes. Linear Fascicle Evaluation (LiFE) takes any connectome as input and predicts diffusion measurements as output, using the difference between the measured and predicted diffusion signals to measure prediction error. Finally, we introduce two metrics that use the prediction error to evaluate the evidence supporting properties of the connectome. One metric compares the mean prediction error between alternative hypotheses, and the second metric compares full distributions of prediction error. We use these metrics to (1) compare tractography algorithms, and (2) test hypotheses about tracts and connections.},

  abstract = {An inherent drawback of the traditional diffusion tensor model is its limited ability to provide detailed information about multidirectional fiber architecture within a voxel. This leads to erroneous fiber tractography results in locations where fiber bundles cross each other. This may lead to the inability to visualize clinically important tracts such as the lateral projections of the corticospinal tract. In this report, we present a deterministic two-tensor eXtended Streamline Tractography (XST) technique, which successfully traces through regions of crossing fibers. We evaluated the method on simulated and in vivo human brain data, comparing the results with the traditional single-tensor and with a probabilistic tractography technique. By tracing the corticospinal tract and correlating with fMRI-determined motor cortex in both healthy subjects and patients with brain tumors, we demonstrate that two-tensor deterministic streamline tractography can accurately identify fiber bundles consistent with anatomy and previously not detected by conventional single tensor tractography. When compared to the dense connectivity maps generated by probabilistic tractography, the method is computationally efficient and generates discrete geometric pathways that are simple to visualize and clinically useful. Detection of crossing white matter pathways can improve neurosurgical visualization of functionally relevant white matter areas.},

Although it has been proven to be particularly effective for studying non-invasively the neuronal architecture of the brain, recent studies have highlighted that the large incidence of false positive connections retrieved by these techniques can significantly bias any connectivity analysis. Some solutions have been proposed to overcome this issue and the ones relying on convex optimization framework showed a significant improvement. Here we propose an evolution of the Convex Optimization Modeling for Microstructure Informed Tractography (COMMIT) framework, that combines basic prior knowledge about brain anatomy with group-sparsity regularization into the optimization problem. We show that the new formulation dramatically reduces the incidence of false positives synthetic data.},

  abstract = {Diffusion MRI fiber tractography is widely used to probe the structural connectivity of the brain, with a range of applications in both clinical and basic neuroscience. Despite widespread use, tractography has well-known pitfalls that limits the anatomical accuracy of this technique. Numerous modern methods have been developed to address these shortcomings through advances in acquisition, modeling, and computation. To test whether these advances improve tractography accuracy, we organized the 3-D Validation of Tractography with Experimental MRI (3D-VoTEM) challenge at the ISBI 2018 conference. We made available three unique independent tractography validation datasets – a physical phantom and two ex vivo brain specimens - resulting in 176 distinct submissions from 9 research groups. By comparing results over a wide range of fiber complexities and algorithmic strategies, this challenge provides a more comprehensive assessment of tractography's inherent limitations than has been reported previously. The central results were consistent across all sub-challenges in that, despite advances in tractography methods, the anatomical accuracy of tractography has not dramatically improved in recent years. Taken together, our results independently confirm findings from decades of tractography validation studies, demonstrate inherent limitations in reconstructing white matter pathways using diffusion MRI data alone, and highlight the need for alternative or combinatorial strategies to accurately map the fiber pathways of the brain.},

However a fundamental limitation of this technology is its non-quantitative nature, i.e. the density of reconstructed connections is not reflective of the density of underlying white matter fibres. As a solution to this problem, we have previously published the “spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms (SIFT)” method, which determines a subset of the streamlines reconstruction such that the streamlines densities throughout the white matter are as close as possible to fibre densities estimated using the spherical deconvolution diffusion model; this permits the use of streamline count as a valid biological marker of connection density. Particular aspects of its performance may have however limited its uptake in the diffusion MRI research community. Here we present an alternative to this method, entitled SIFT2, which provides a more logically direct and computationally efficient solution to the streamlines connectivity quantification problem: by determining an appropriate cross-sectional area multiplier for each streamline rather than removing streamlines altogether, biologically accurate measures of fibre connectivity are obtained whilst making use of the complete streamlines reconstruction.},

This filtering is guided by the results of spherical deconvolution of the diffusion signal, hence the acronym SIFT: spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms. Data sets processed by this algorithm show a marked reduction in known reconstruction biases, and improved biological plausibility. Emerging methods in diffusion MRI, particularly those that aim to characterise and compare the structural connectivity of the brain, should benefit from the improved accuracy of the reconstruction.},

  abstract = {Diffusion-weighted (DW) MR images contain information about the orientation of brain white matter fibres that potentially can be used to study human brain connectivity in vivo using tractography techniques. Currently, the diffusion tensor model is widely used to extract fibre directions from DW-MRI data, but fails in regions containing multiple fibre orientations. The spherical deconvolution technique has recently been proposed to address this limitation. It provides an estimate of the fibre orientation distribution (FOD) by assuming the DW signal measured from any fibre bundle is adequately described by a single response function. However, the deconvolution is ill-conditioned and susceptible to noise contamination. This tends to introduce artefactual negative regions in the FOD, which are clearly physically impossible. In this study, the introduction of a constraint on such negative regions is proposed to improve the conditioning of the spherical deconvolution. This approach is shown to provide FOD estimates that are robust to noise whilst preserving angular resolution. The approach also permits the use of super-resolution, whereby more FOD parameters are estimated than were actually measured, improving the angular resolution of the results. The method provides much better defined fibre orientation estimates, and allows orientations to be resolved that are separated by smaller angles than previously possible. This should allow tractography algorithms to be designed that are able to track reliably through crossing fibre regions.},

  abstract = {Water diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is a powerful tool for studying biological tissue microarchitectures in vivo. Recently, there has been increased effort to develop quantitative dMRI methods to probe both length scale and orientation information in diffusion media. Diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) is one such approach that aims to resolve such information based on the three‐dimensional diffusion propagator at each voxel. However, in practice, only the orientation component of the propagator function is preserved when deriving the orientation distribution function. Here, we demonstrate how a straightforward extension of the linear spherical deconvolution (SD) model can be used to probe tissue orientation structures over a range (or “spectrum”) of length scales with minimal assumptions on the underlying microarchitecture. Using high b‐value Cartesian q‐space data on a rat brain tissue sample, we demonstrate how this “restriction spectrum imaging” (RSI) model allows for separating the volume fraction and orientation distribution of hindered and restricted diffusion, which we argue stems primarily from diffusion in the extraneurite and intraneurite water compartment, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate how empirical RSI estimates of the neurite orientation distribution and volume fraction capture important additional structure not afforded by traditional DSI or fixed‐scale SD‐like reconstructions, particularly in gray matter. We conclude that incorporating length scale information in geometric models of diffusion offers promise for advancing state‐of‐the‐art dMRI methods beyond white matter into gray matter structures while allowing more detailed quantitative characterization of water compartmentalization and histoarchitecture of healthy and diseased tissue.

  abstract = {White matter fiber tracking using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) provides a noninvasive approach to map brain connections, but improving anatomical accuracy has been a significant challenge since the birth of tractography methods. Utilizing tractography in brain studies therefore requires understanding of its technical limitations to avoid shortcomings and pitfalls. This review explores tractography limitations and how different white matter pathways pose different challenges to fiber tracking methodologies. We summarize the pros and cons of commonly-used methods, aiming to inform how tractography and its related analysis may lead to questionable results. Extending these experiences, we review the clinical utilization of tractography in patients with brain tumors and traumatic brain injury, starting from tensor-based tractography to more advanced methods. We discuss current limitations and highlight novel approaches in the context of these two conditions to inform future tractography developments.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), a practical diffusion MRI technique for estimating the microstructural complexity of dendrites and axons in vivo on clinical MRI scanners. Such indices of neurites relate more directly to and provide more specific markers of brain tissue microstructure than standard indices from diffusion tensor imaging, such as fractional anisotropy (FA). Mapping these indices over the whole brain on clinical scanners presents new opportunities for understanding brain development and disorders. The proposed technique enables such mapping by combining a three-compartment tissue model with a two-shell high-angular-resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) protocol optimized for clinical feasibility. An index of orientation dispersion is defined to characterize angular variation of neurites. We evaluate the method both in simulation and on a live human brain using a clinical 3T scanner. Results demonstrate that NODDI provides sensible neurite density and orientation dispersion estimates, thereby disentangling two key contributing factors to FA and enabling the analysis of each factor individually. We additionally show that while orientation dispersion can be estimated with just a single HARDI shell, neurite density requires at least two shells and can be estimated more accurately with the optimized two-shell protocol than with alternative two-shell protocols. The optimized protocol takes about 30 min to acquire, making it feasible for inclusion in a typical clinical setting. We further show that sampling fewer orientations in each shell can reduce the acquisition time to just 10 min with minimal impact on the accuracy of the estimates. This demonstrates the feasibility of NODDI even for the most time-sensitive clinical applications, such as neonatal and dementia imaging.},

The small size of many neuroimaging studies led to concerns about poor reproducibility of research findings, and calls for the comparison and poolingData pooling of multi-cohort datasets to establish the consistency of reported effects. Across studies diffusion MRIDiffusion MRI protocols vary in spatial, angular and q-space resolution, b-value, as well as hardware used—all of which affect measured diffusion parameters. Efforts to compare and poolData pooling dMRIDiffusion MRI measures use meta- or mega- analytical techniques to compensate for these sources of variance. Meta-analytical methods gauge the consistency of effects, and mega-analytical methods involve mathematical or statistical transformations of the data. Here, we review some recent advances that allowed the diffusion community to create large scale population studies with greater rigor and generalizability than was previously attainable by individual studies.},
